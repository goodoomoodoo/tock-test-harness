  <h3>Installation</h3>
  <p>Click <a href="https://goodoomoodoo.github.io/tock-test-harness/GUIDE">here</a> to see the installation guide on
    how to set up your very
    own hardware harness and connect it to the main Tock repository.
  </p>

  <h3>About the Repo</h1>
    <h5>Our design consists of one main repo which uses two existing Tock repos.</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/goodoomoodoo/tock-test-harness">Tock Test Harness</a> (Our main repo) (Owned by us
        for now until we officially launch the CI)
        <br>
        which consists of:
        <ul>
          <li>lib: a folder containing all python code that runs on the Pi during testing.</li>
          <li>runner_init.py: a script used in the initial setup of the Pi</li>
          <li>config.toml: a configuration file created by runner_init that saves information about the target board for
            that Pi as well as a harness identifier.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/goodoomoodoo/tock">Tock</a>: (The main Tock OS repo) (Forked for now until we
        officially launch the CI)
        <br>
        from which we use:
        <ul>
          <li>/.github/workflows/ci-test.yaml: a configuration file that specifies to Github what to run and where (all
            of the tests for each Raspberry Pi)</li>
          <li>
            boards: a directory we use to compile Tock for the target board as
            well as save board-specific test information in a configuration file called test.config.toml.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/goodoomoodoo/libtock-c">libtock-c</a>: (The main repo for Tock OS apps) (Forked
        for now until we
        officially launch the CI)
        <br>
        from which we use:
        <ul>
          <li>/examples/ci-test, where there is a directory for each test.
            <br>
            These are general and can be tested by any board with the
            necessary features tested in the test. The name of a test directory can be uniquely specified in the
            "test.config.toml" file. Inside the directory is a test.py file and main.c file for the Raspberry Pi test
            and Tock test app respectively, as well as a Makefile to compile the test app.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

    </ul>
