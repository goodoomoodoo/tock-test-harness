  <h3>Overview</h1>
    <p>Tock is an embedded operating system that supports many embedded
      boards and provides an abstraction layer for many of their features
      and capabilities. Up until our project, developers have had to manually
      test the OS on each of their respective boards and provide feedback in forums and Github issue threads. Our goal
      is
      to speed up and automate this process, allowing for a true CI experience. After every pushed commit or
      successfully
      accepted pull request into the main tock repository, our system automatically runs a set of tests on actual
      hardware
      and then reports back the outcome of these tests to the Github "Actions" tab.</p>
